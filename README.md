# face-recognition-attendance-system
Face Fusion is an AI-powered face recognition attendance system designed to automate and streamline student attendance tracking. The system eliminates manual processes by using real-time facial recognition to mark attendance, ensuring accuracy, security, and efficiency in educational institutions.

Features
This system allows real-time face detection and recognition using computer vision techniques. It securely stores and manages student records, ensuring data integrity and preventing proxy attendance. Additionally, it provides an intuitive user interface for administrators to monitor attendance records, generate reports, and analyze trends.

Machine Learning & Technologies Used
Face Fusion is built using Python, OpenCV, and Deep Learning models for facial recognition. The system uses Haar Cascades and CNN-based models to detect and verify faces with high accuracy. MySQL is used for managing student records, while Tkinter provides a user-friendly interface for interaction.

Outcomes & Future Scope
The project significantly improves attendance management, reducing time and errors compared to traditional methods. Future improvements include cloud integration, real-time API-based authentication, and mobile app support for wider accessibility.
